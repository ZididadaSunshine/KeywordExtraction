Clearloans are excellent, they helped me out when I needed it most and they did it very promptly!
Staff was good but waiting time on phone was a hour and half to long
It took while but once everything got settled the experience was great ! Would highly recommend if you have good gaurantors
They did a good job by accepting my application
They are really understanding
Very fast to deal with! Friendly helpful staff the only downside is it took over an hour on hold waiting to organise finance.
Were great to deal with and very responsive-fast and did exactly what they said.
Trying to get through to speak with someone is a joke at least an hour wait on the phone otherwise great service
Clear Loans is a quick easy application process for both lendee and guarantor.
Friendly and helpful customer service.
Can't fault them.
They are very precise and accurate with information making sure both the Lendee and especially the Guarantor are of a clear understanding of the contact.
Very happy with the process and service.
Very helpful and understanding I was struggling to get a loan from anywhere else but they were able to help straight away its was done quick and easy loan was paid same day
From beginning to end I dealt with Maria. She was an absolute gem great customer service thankyou so much. I would definately recommend this company. Thanks again
Pretty prompt although Jeff was rude and a personality of a piece of cardboard. Not very personable and very blunt.
