Clearloans are excellent, they helped me out when I needed it most and they did it very promptly!
Staff was good but waiting time on phone was a hour and half to long
It took while but once everything got settled the experience was great ! Would highly recommend if you have good gaurantors
They did a good job by accepting my application
They are really understanding
Very fast to deal with! Friendly helpful staff the only downside is it took over an hour on hold waiting to organise finance.
Were great to deal with and very responsive-fast and did exactly what they said.
Trying to get through to speak with someone is a joke at least an hour wait on the phone otherwise great service
Clear Loans is a quick easy application process for both lendee and guarantor.
Friendly and helpful customer service.
Can't fault them.
They are very precise and accurate with information making sure both the Lendee and especially the Guarantor are of a clear understanding of the contact.
Very happy with the process and service.
Very helpful and understanding I was struggling to get a loan from anywhere else but they were able to help straight away its was done quick and easy loan was paid same day
From beginning to end I dealt with Maria. She was an absolute gem great customer service thankyou so much. I would definately recommend this company. Thanks again
Pretty prompt although Jeff was rude and a personality of a piece of cardboard. Not very personable and very blunt.

Thank you so much for helping me out I will be telling my friends and family about how good yous are thank you again.
Fast and friendly service
They were fair. They gave me a second chance for a loan when I really needed it . I would recommend people with credit that's not so good to try clear loans first .
The service was awesome, the friendly staff were helpful and very polite. Would recommend them to anyone, and have.
Clearloans customer service was great they made the whole process as easy and simple for me as they possibly could, the loan consultant were so kind and friendly about the whole process 5 stars
They was quick very nice and helped you out as fast as they can. There the greatest.!!
Great customer service And extremely fast!! Thankyou. Highly recommended!
Took a little longer than expected. Would help to know what information will be needed during the phone calls.
The consultant was patient though.
Thanks for your help guys wonderful service
Thanks! Very patient and good service
Great customer service and a pleasant and easy transaction. The whole application process was pleasant, except the one little thing that bothered me, but not enough to cancel the application. The money(after the application is approved) goes to guarantorâ€™s account. Other than that, every question is clearly answered and customer service is really friendly and patient.Thank you.
Communication was fantastic and team member was more than helpful with my enquires
